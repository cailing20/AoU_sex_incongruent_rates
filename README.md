# Navigating Electronic Health Record Accuracy by Examination of Sex Incongruent Conditions

## Description
This repository contains the R code in a Jupyter notebook necessary to reproduce the findings presented in the manuscript titled "Navigating Electronic Health Record Accuracy by Examination of Sex Incongruent Conditions." The code enables users to calculate Incongruence Rates (IR) using sex-specific medical conditions as detailed in the study, utilizing data from the All of Us Research Program's version 7 (v7) EHR dataset.

## Manuscript
The manuscript associated with this repository is under review in the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association.
